They’re joined by former NSW Premier Bob Carr, political editor Paul Kelly and one of our youngest and most forthright commentators Jan Fran. 
On the agenda: the US election, the 45th anniversary of Gough Whitlam’s dismissal, China, the proposal for a royal commission into media ownership, and national secrets.
Jenny Hocking's long campaign finally forced the National Archives to release correspondence between Sir John Kerr and Buckingham Palace, letters the Queen had intended be kept secret. Her book The Palace Letters raises questions about the role of the monarchy in Australia, and the public’s right to know our own history. Time for a Republic? 
Discuss the Questions
Here are the questions our panel faced this week. You can discuss their answers on the .
WOMEN IN POLITICS
Josie Cullen asked: The majority of politicians are men and there is continual reference to the boys club. Why is this such a hostile environment for women to enter? How can we support and level out the playing field?
TRUMP’S RISE TO POWER
Nick Kenny asked: There have been a lot of arguments in the media that Trumpism was a reaction to the so-called ‘cultural left’. Joe Hildebrand wrote that half of America is willing to put up with almost anything including incompetence, chaos, corruption, and bad policy to have their values reflected, rather than dictated to them, and unless Biden addresses this, it will be the last election the Democrats win for a long time. How valid is this argument and what are the implications for Australia?
SPEAKING THE SAME LANGUAGE
Akeel Sumar asked: In you memoir you said in your dealings with President Trump, you found him no less rational than other billionaires you worked with and despite your differences, as businessmen, you both spoke the same language. In light of the events of the past week and the President’s blatant and disturbing efforts to erode the democratic process of the United States as we know it, do you still consider to speak the same language as him?
CHINA STANCE
Steven Hong asked: My question is to Mr Turnbull and Mr Carr; Recently our Government has become quite hawkish towards China. If you were back in your position as PM and Foreign Minister, would you take a similar stance, or a different approach?
CHINESE AUSTRALIANS
Osmond Chiu asked: Does the panel believe Senator Eric Abetz's unprompted demand that I and two other Chinese Australians condemn the Chinese Communist Party is acceptable behaviour from a Senator?
PALACE LETTERS
Jill Christensen asked: The recently released Kerr Letters appear to confirm that Sir John Kerr acted appropriately and within the constitution to advise Queen Elizabeth II of his intention to sack Gough Whitlam. Why then has he been vilified and denigrated for this decision to remove Whitlam?
NEWS LTD BIAS
Carol Kiernan asked: Paul Kelly, are you concerned, like I am, at how politically biased The Australian newspaper and other News Corp media outlets in Australia have become, with their minimisation of critical issues such as climate change and their unwillingness to hold conservative governments to account? And to the wider panel, do you support Kevin Rudd's call for a Royal Commission into media ownership in Australia?"
